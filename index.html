<h3>Guide to peer production elements for websites</h3>
<details>
  <summary><b>What is peer production and why is there a need for a webdesign guide specifically for this?</b></summary>
  <p> Peer production is a way of online distributed knowledge production that relies on the collective intelligence of 
    self-organizing groups of individuals, without or with less rigid hierarchical control and management (Benkler et al., 2015). 
    This mode of knowledge production is most commonly known from projects like Wikipedia or Open Source Software. 
  
    Because contributors self-organize in peer production, online environments that are tailored to the task and that 
    facilitate collaboration and coordination can have an important impact on the success of the project. </p>
