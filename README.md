# Best Practices for Online Peer-Production
This is a resource of best practices for the peer-production of knowledge, meant to serve as inspiration for people who want to build peer-production online platforms. 

This resource is developed as part of the [PhD of Katharina Kloppenborg](https://github.com/katoss/phd-project), as well as the [Open Life Science mentoring program](https://openlifesci.org/). 

It is currently a work in progress, so it might be worth to check it out every now and then in the following months :)
