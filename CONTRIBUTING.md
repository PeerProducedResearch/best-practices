# Contributing to the "Best Practices for Peer-Producing Knowledge" project

First of all: Thank you for taking the time to contribute! <3

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. This document is a work in progress. If you miss any information or find some points confusing, please let us know (for example, by opening an issue here on GitHub or by writing an email to katharina.kloppenborg@cri-paris.org).

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PeerProducedResearch/best-practices/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to katharina.kloppenborg@cri-paris.org.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Peer-production of knowledge: What is it and why are you collecting best practices?

Peer-production is a way of production in which communities of individuals self-organize. Typically, it has less rigid hierarchical structures than traditional business models.
It is distinct from crowdsourcing, because it does not only allow people to work on pre-defined micro-tasks, but allows participation in the whole knowledge production process, including the conception of tasks and solutions.
Peer-production comes in two distinct flavors: On the one hand, there is commons-based peer production (CBPP), which is know from Wikipedia or open source software. Then there is firm-hosted peer production, found for example on Yelp or Trip Advisor. While the first flavor comprises peer-production also in governance and management, these two elements are left to the management of the respective companies in the other (Benkler, 2016).
The [Peer-Produced Research Lab](https://peer-produced.science/) at CRI in Paris studies the potential of peer-production approaches for grassroot research projects, which is also the context of this blog.

To be most effective, peer-production projects need specific online platforms that help users to indirectly coordinate their work. To find out and share what others tried and tested in practice and research, we started this blog!

### Who do you write this blog for?

This blog is thought as an alternative, more accessible way of communicating UX reserach results in the context of the PhD of [@katoss](https://github.com/katoss). We think it could be useful for anyone interested in building online platforms that support people to collaboratively build knowledge.
This could be User Experience designers, web developers, managers of peer-production platforms, or researchers in any related fields. 

## How can I contribute?

### Commenting on blog posts

Feel free to comment on existing blog posts! For example, you could report your own experiences with your thoughts on the best practice, ask questions or tell us if and why you found the blog post useful - basically whatever you'd like to say. Just keep in mind our code of conduct :)
To add a comment, you need to create an account for disqus, our comment system.

### Adding new blog posts

This project is open to contributions! :) If you have anything related to best practices for the peer-production of knowledge to share, you are very welcome to write a blog post and publish it here!
In the folder "posts" you find a template for blog posts that you can copy and use for your own post. Please have a look at other blog posts to look for naming conventions for blog posts and images.
If you have a suggestion for a blog post, but don't have the time to write a blog post yourself, feel free to open an issue with your suggestion!

### Improving the website code

If you have experience in web development, feel free to fork this project and make a pull request for changes. 
Another option is to open an issue (this works also if you want to communicate a bug or some other issue you found, but don't have the time or experience to update the code yourself).

### Improving the contribution guidelines, readme, or code of conduct

If you have suggestions for improvements of any of the supplementary information material, feel free to open an issue about it or to create a pull request with your suggested changes.
