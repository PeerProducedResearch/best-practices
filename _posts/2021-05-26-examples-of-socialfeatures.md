## Direct vs indirect communication and why social features are important for community-building

The actual knowledge production in peer production usually takes place on the platform itself and people communicate indirectly via the digital signs (for example, they could comment on the work of someone else, [reproduce an activity]({{site.baseurl}}/I-did-it-feature/), [agree or disagree with a data classification]({{site.baseurl}}/validation-community-ids-inat/) of somebody else, or edit an existing article). Indirect communication is a principle of _stigmergy_ (Dipple et al., 2012), a crucial element of online peer production websites.

Direct communication is not mediated by digital signs and not necessarily work related. It can take place offline in the contexts of more or less formal meetings. In online environments, it can be enabled via chats, emails or (video)calls. Exchanging directly, especially face-to-face can be an important part of community-building and can increase trust (Rocco, 1998). Regular open calls (e.g. like [here on Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call)) can, apart from allowing for general exchange in a less formal atmosphere, encourage newcomers to join the project.
