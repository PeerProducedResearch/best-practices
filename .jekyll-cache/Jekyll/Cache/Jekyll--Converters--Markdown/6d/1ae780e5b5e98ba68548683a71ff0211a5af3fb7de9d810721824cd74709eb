<h2 id="what-platform-are-we-talking-about">What platform are we talking about?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> is a a citizen science online platform where anyone can share and identify observations of wild animals and plants.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-knowledge-production-flow">What is a knowledge production flow?</h2>

<p>A knowledge production flow summarizes the basic steps users take when interacting with the platform in order to produce knowledge.
The steps were identified using a method similar to a cognitive walkthrough. A cognitive walkthrough is a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability">usability</a> inspection method focussing on a user‚Äôs problem solving process, assuming exploration of the website as the main learning strategy. In our case, the focus was not on usability, but on understanding the knowledge creation process and on the existence of peer production elements.
Modeling the knowledge production process in this way helps to identify how users interact with the platform and if and how they collaborate 
during their work - an important step to see if and how peer production takes place on the respective platform, and if there are ways to 
increase peer production if wanted.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-knowledge-production-work-on-inaturalist">How does knowledge production work on iNaturalist?</h2>

<p>A basic knowledge production flow on iNaturalist (see Figure 1) can start with a user
making observations of living organisms that they are interested in. The context might
be individual walks, or community data collection events ‚Äì named ‚ÄúBioblitzes‚Äù ‚Äì or other
user-generated data collection projects. The interaction with iNaturalist starts with the
user uploading their observation to the platform, providing a guess on the species. As a
next step, other users participate in a communal validation process by adding their
guess of the species, until the observation is labelled as research grade. Research
grade observations then go into the scientific GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information
Facility) database. Users are free to only take part in either the uploading or the
identification of species.</p>

<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>

<p>While knowledge production on iNaturalist is quite straightforward, users have a certain amount of creative freedom (e.g. choosing which kind of observations they
are interested in, how much, when and where they want to upload, if they rather identify or upload, or if they want to start or participate in a data collection 
project). They are also free to use the data for their own purposes, even though data analysis is not part of the platform itself. Apart from the collaborative
creation of a biodiversity database that consists of all the observations that users uploaded, there is a more direct form of collaboration in their communal validation
process (click <a href="/design-practices/validation-community-ids-inat/">here</a> to read more about communal validation on iNaturalist).</p>
