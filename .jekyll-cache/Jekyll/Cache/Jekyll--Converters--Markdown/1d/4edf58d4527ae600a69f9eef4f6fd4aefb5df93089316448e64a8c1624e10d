<p><a href="https://publiclab.org">Public Lab</a> aims to empower people to address environmental justice issues through community science and open technology. They focus on the collaborative development, sharing, reuse and adaption of DIY scientific tools.</p>

<p>Tasks should be broken down into modules of different size/granularity, so that users can contribute anything from tiny edits to e.g. a complete new feature for a software. This is important to attract contributors with different skills and backgrounds and to match varying amounts of time and motivation (Kostakis &amp; Bauwens, 2021). Small and easy modules are also a good way to encourage newcomers to contribute.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-public-lab-implement-granularity-and-modularity">How does Public Lab implement granularity and modularity?</h2>

<p>On Public Lab, a wide range of tasks, from the identification of research questions to
conceptualizing and conducting research projects can be performed on the platform.
Users are free to use, adapt and contribute to resources according to their particular
needs, according to Public Labs perception of science as a creative, open-ended
process (Breen et al., 2019). The granularity of tasks is high: It is possible to perform
small tasks, like editing minor parts in wiki documents or commenting on another user‚Äôs
artifacts, but also to replicate research approaches or to plan and conduct whole
research projects from start to finish.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways in which people can
build on the artifacts other users created. For example, there are wiki pages for topics or
projects that can be edited by anyone, and users are encouraged to reinvent existing
DIY tools for their own purposes by replicating existing activity artifacts. These activities
mainly contain instruction manuals for building and using DIY research tools (see <a href="https://publiclab.org/methods">here for an overview</a>). On activity
pages, thanks to a tagging system, there is also a list of links to all replications of the
respective activity. Users who tried an activity themselves are invited to click the <a href="/design-practices/I-did-it-feature/">‚ÄúI did
this‚Äù</a> button on the original activity‚Äôs page and add their own experiences in form of a
new activity or a comment, in order to give general feedback or feedback for their use
case. In the comment sections, when users ask a question, a link saying ‚ÄúIs this a question?‚Äù 
appears, which allows anyone to transfer <a href="/design-practices/comments-to-questions-publiclab/">a question in the comments section to a question artifact</a>, 
which makes it appear on topic pages and can mark the beginning of a research project.</p>
