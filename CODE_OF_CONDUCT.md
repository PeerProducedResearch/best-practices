# Code of Conduct

This "Best Practices for Peer-Production" project is an open blog that invites anyone to contribute by commenting or adding blog posts. 

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who contributes or participates in events related to this project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces related to this project. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which we resolve any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

## Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Carpentries events and platforms:

- Write articles that are on topic and inform the reader about good examples of features for or research on online platforms that facilitate the peer-production of knowledge
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members


## Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Spam comments or blog posts
- Blog posts that have the function to advertise a platform or other product, rather than to inform about best practices for peer-production
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, their access to contribute (in comments or blog posts) might be blocked. Comments or blog posts containing violations of this Code of Conduct might be deleted.
